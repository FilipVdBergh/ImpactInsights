Impact Insights is a tool for constructing and visualizing specific types of impact networks. These networks contain
four layers, aligned vertically: activities, outputs, outcomes and impact. These layers contain boxes with text. These
boxes can be connected to each other if they are on the same layer, and if they are one layer apart.

The user defines the contents of the boxes, and the relationships between the boxes. In addition, the tool can rearrange
the boxes to minimize global connection length. The tool is to be used in group sessions, and needs attractive
animations. The boxes, their positions, and their relationships can be saved to be used later. In addition, the boxes
may be exported to PDF.

The area object contains all boxes, and has the following properties:
1. Length, Height
2. Color of background, Picure on background
3. Color of layer 1, 2, 3, 4, Font color of layer 1, 2, 3, 4.
4. Font, size
5. Title
6. List of objects (boxes) per layer

The boxes have the following properties:
1. Id
2. X, Y
3. Text
4. Alternative text (to be used for detail of measuring the indicator)
5. Collection of connections to other boxes
